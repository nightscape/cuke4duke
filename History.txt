== 0.1.8-SNAPSHOT (In Git)

=== New Features
* Ability to call steps from step definitions in Scala. (Jon-Anders Teigen)
* Ability to call steps from step definitions in Guice. (Henning Jensen)

=== Bugfixes
* Made programming language dependencies optional (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed Guice problems regarding the instantiation of non-static inner & anonymous classes

== 0.1.7 2009-10-15

This is an exciting new release with several great new features. (You must upgrade to cucumber 0.4.2).

You can now call other steps by String:

  @When("^I call another step$")
  public void iCallAnotherStep() {
      Given("it is magic");
  }

This is currently only supported if you use PicoContainer or Spring (but not yet Guice - see below).
Your Step Definition class must inherit from cuke4duke.Steps and declare a dependency on cuke4duke.StepMother in the constructor.

Another great new feature is support for Guice. Cuke4Duke now supports three DI containers!

Ioke support is also getting better. It now supports snippets and has better error reporting.

=== New Features
* Better ANSI color support on Windows with http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/wac. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Guice support (Henning Jensen)
* Enable Java step definitions to call other steps indirectly by just providing a string. (#26 Aslak Hellesøy, Trond Marius Øvstetun)
* Ioke snippets and better error reporting. (Ola Bini)

== 0.1.6 2009-10-09

IMPORTANT: You *must* upgrade to JRuby 1.4.0RC1 and Cucumber 0.4.0.

There are several steps to this:
1) rm -Rf ~/.m2/repository/.gem
3) Change your POM to use JRuby 1.4.0RC1
3) Change your POM to use Cucumber 0.4.0
2) Run mvn integration-test once with -Dcucumber.installGems=true

=== New features
* Ioke support (Ola Bini, Aslak Hellesøy, Sam Aaron, Jakob Skov-Pedersen)
* Upgraded to use Cucumber 0.4.0 (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added a simpler way to add a new programming language. See clj_language.rb for an example. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* The cucumber usage formatter is working, reporting unused step definitions. (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.1.5 2009-09-27

This is a very exciting release, as it sports support for 3 (!) new programming languages for Cuke4Duke. This means you can now
use all of Cucumber's goodness and write your step definitions in the following programming languages:

* Scala
* Clojure
* Javascript
* Java
* Groovy

The Scala support was mostly Jon-Anders Teigen's effort, with a little help from Ole Christian Rynning and Aslak Hellesøy.
Thanks to Ben Mabey for making the Clojure example code work!

Important! This snapshot requires cucumber 0.3.104, so go ahead and update your POMs with <gem>cucumber --version 0.3.104</gem>
and install it once with -Dcucumber.installGems=true

=== New Features
* Scala support. (Jon-Anders Teigen)
* Javascript support (via Rhino). (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Clojure support. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Changed Features
* Minimum Cucumber version is now 0.3.103. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Regular expression matching in step definitions are now native to the used programming language. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Groovy step definitions *must* use Regexps, not Strings. Just prepend a ~ to your regexp string. (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.1.4 2009-09-21

This release has several small backwards incompatible changes that should for the most part only affect your build scripts. 
If you're using Groovy you also have to change your step definitions to use strings instead of regexps.

Make sure you read the release notes carefully before upgrading!

=== New features
* Java snippets should now produce valid Java code (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Examples' Maven builds install aslakhellesoy-ansicolor (needed for the poor windows users) (Aslak Hellesøy)
* examples/celerity upgraded to celerity 0.0.7 and jetty 7.0.0.1beta3 (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added -Dcucumber.extraArgs command line argument that lets us append extra cucumber arguments on the command line. E.g -Dcucmber.extraArgs="--color --tag @dev" (#14 Torbjørn Vatn)

=== Changed Features
* The Maven "feature" goal has been renamed to "cucumber" (Aslak Hellesøy)
* The Maven <gem> element has changed. You can now pass extra arguments, and there are no funny : delimiters. See examples. (#22 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Groovy step definitions must use String instead of Regexp. The regexp matching happens on the Ruby side, so Regexp was misleading (Aslak Hellesøy)
* -Dcuke4duke.objectFactory classes have changed package from cuke4duke.internal.java to cuke4duke.internal.jvmclass (Aslak Hellesøy)
* --require **/*.java no longer supported. Use --require **/*.class instead (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Removed features
* The Maven property configuration.args (<configuration><args>...) has been removed. Use configuration.cucumberArgs instead. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Bugfixes
* diffHashes method in Table not working properly (#18 Darrin Holst)

== 0.1.3 2009-09-03

This release improves Java annotations and build scripts. Nothing major, but worth an upgrade!
Make sure you upgrade the cucumber gem to 0.3.99.

=== New features
* No longer print java command on failures. If needed it can be printed by passing -X to Maven. (#16 Aslak Hellesøy, Darrin Holst)
* Added new @Pending annotation that can be used as a substitute for Ruby-Cucumber's #pending method. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Changed features
* Gem dependencies in Maven no longer use the form gem:version:source. rubyforge, github and gemcutter are always used. (Darrin Holst, Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Bugfixes
* undefined method `jlength' (NoMethodError) for ambiguous matches with --guess. Requires Cucumber 0.3.99. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* The @Before annotation of a superclass has no effect in a subclass. (Works now if superclass is abstract) (Aslak Hellesøy)
* @Before tag should have optional scenario parameter (#11 Aslak Hellesøy, Henning Jensen)
* Fixed broken Ant script for Groovy example. (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.1.2 2009-08-25

Bugfix release. This release requires Cucumber 0.3.98.

=== Bugfixes
* Backtrace filtering is working again. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Maven plugin resolve test dependencies so test scoped jars are included on the classpath (#9 Darrin Holst)
* Allow for PyStrings by converting string type objects to strings instead of casting (#10 Darrin Holst)

== 0.1.1 2009-08-23

This release is just an update to comply with API changes in Cucumber 0.3.97

== 0.1.0 2009-08-17

This release is almost a complete rewrite of Cuke4Duke's internals. This is to take advantage
of Cucumber 0.3.96' new plugin API for language add-ons like Cuke4Duke. (The plan is to use the
same plugin API for a .NET equivalent of Cuke4Duke).

Check out the new Groovy DSL! It's almost identical to the native Ruby DSL.

This means that your existing Cuke4Duke project will probably break. If you're using Pure Java
Step Definitions, you no longer have to register them in support/env.rb. Instead you have to
use --require. Choosing between PicoContainer or Spring is done with the -Dcuke4duke.objectFactory
JVM argument.

=== New Features
* Automatically load StepDefinitions with --require (works with .java and .groovy) (Aslak Hellesøy)
* New Groovy DSL. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added support for After blocks (Juan Barreneche)

=== Removed features
* There are no more cuke4duke/*.rb files that you need to require in support/env.rb. You don't even need support/env.rb. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Changed Features
* The cuke4duke.spring.Steps annotation has been renamed to cuke4duke.spring.StepDefinitions

=== Bugfixes
* Java and Ruby step defs should be able to coexist (#4 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Downgraded JRuby from 1.4dev to 1.3.1 so people don't have to build their own JRuby (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Upgrade webtest example to jarib-celerity to 0.0.6.12 (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.0.7 2009-07-29

This release fixes compatibility issues with the latest Cucumber release, extends the Table API
and improves the Maven plugin in several areas.

=== New features
* Added new jvmArgs property to Maven plugin. See the Spring example for sample usage. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Cucumber gem (and optional version) must be declared in POM. -Dcucumber.installGems no longer installs it by default.  (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added several more methods to cuke4duke.Table, including the new diff methods.  (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Compatibility with cucumber 0.3.92  (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Ability to specify cucumber bin with -Dcucumber.bin= or <configuration><bin> in the Maven plugin (POM).  (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.0.5 (Never properly released)

=== Bugfixes
* Everything compiles on Java 5 (Ole Christian Rynning)

== 0.0.4 2009-06-07

This is the first release of Cuke4Duke that mostly works.

=== New features
* Spring support (Trond Marius Øvstetun)
* Maven support! (Ole Christian Rynning, Øystein Ellingbø)
* Strings are converted to int when needed (Eivind Waaler)
* Run with JUnit (Kaare Nilsen)
* Simple @Before hooks (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Use pure java step definitions (Aslak Hellesøy)
